# Julia Template Repository
A repository meant to handle integration with automated actions (CI, automated doc builds, formatting checks, etc) to allow for quicker spin-up of Julia projects.

## Quick start:
1. Clone this repo
2. 

## Slow start:
This is really the output of `PkgTemplates.jl` with modified github workflows (updated action versions, bug fixes, removing actions that are unnecessary in the short term). In general, this repo could be completely subsumed by `PkgTemplates.jl`, except that I don't want to figure out how to write templated files for everything I want...Maybe someday.
